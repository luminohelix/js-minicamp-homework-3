Feynman Writing Prompts
		
	 Objects - An object, or associative array, is a collection of properties paired with values.
	 Properties - A key:value pair in an object.
	 Methods - Functions that can be made as values for properties in an object.
	 for in loop - Loops through properties inside of an object.
	 dot notation vs bracket notation - Dot notation (object.property) is usually easier to read in terms of accessing property values in an object. Bracket notation (object[notation]) works similarly to how you would access a value in an array, but is better for dealing with variable property names.
